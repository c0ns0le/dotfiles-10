You should avoid them, because they might not do what you expect on all shells.\n\n## How does it look?\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonwhitaker/atom-checkbashisms/master/screenshot.png)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou'll need a copy of `checkbashisms` installed on your `$PATH`. You can also\nmanually set the path in Atom's settings.\n\nOn Debian-style Linuxes:\n\n    apt-get install devscripts\n\nOn Mac OS X:\n\n    brew install checkbashisms\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/simonwhitaker/linter-checkbashisms/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/simonwhitaker/linter-checkbashisms#readme","_id":"linter-checkbashisms@0.1.5","_shasum":"deb258aa753b97a5fa9e2792124141c185b57f71","_resolved":"file:../d-116412-62718-xg1y58/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116412-62718-xg1y58/package.tgz"}
