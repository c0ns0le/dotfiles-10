The public version can be found in the [atom-plugin-public repository](https://github.com/kiteco/atom-plugin-public).\n\nAs long as this repository is private **never publish the package from here** (see more on publication below).\n\n## Installation\n\nTo setup the development environment run the following commands:\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:kiteco/atom-plugin.git\napm install\nnpm run setup\n```\n\nThe `npm run setup` command will create a `public` directory in the project that will be a clone of the `atom-plugin-public` repository.\n\n## Testing Your Local Changes\n\nRun `apm link` in the private plugin directory and reload Atom.\n\n## Testing The Public Version\n\nRun `apm link` in the plugin plugin directory and reload Atom.\n\n## Build The Public Plugin\n\nRun the `npm run publish:prepare` command to copy all the files and obfuscate the sources into the `public directory`.\n\nThis command does not publish anything yet, it's just updating the public directory with the latest code and assets.\n\n## Publish A New Version\n\nTo publish a new version of the public plugin a few operations are required, which are packaged in the `npm run publish:*` commands.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n1. The `publish:prepare` command will be run, copying the assets and obfuscating the sources in the public directory.\n2. The `package.json` file of the public plugin will be updated with the latest changes from the private one through the `package:public` command. Fields like `dependencies` and atom related fields will be updated using the private `package.json` as the source of trust.\n3. Then the changes are committed using the `commit:public` command.\n4. The new version is then published through `apm publish` and the version argument corresponding to the npm script used initially.\n5. Once published, the new package's version is then copied back to the private `package.json` file, a new commit is created and tagged with that version so that the private and public repositories tags stay in sync. All of this is done using the `commit:private` command.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kiteco/atom-plugin/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/kiteco/atom-plugin#readme","_id":"kite@0.6.4","_shasum":"d76e6dbc8c02de6154f17614b46233848ea29025","_resolved":"file:../d-117010-30079-1f5655y/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117010-30079-1f5655y/package.tgz"}
